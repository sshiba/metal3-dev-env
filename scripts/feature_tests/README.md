# Feature tests framework

## Build Status

[![Ubuntu V1alpha4 build status](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_ubuntu/badge/icon?subject=Feature-tests)](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_ubuntu/)
[![Centos V1alpha4 build status](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_centos/badge/icon?subject=Feature-tests-centos)](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_centos/)
[![Ubuntu V1alpha4 build status](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_upgrade_ubuntu/badge/icon?subject=Feature-tests-upgrade)](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_upgrade_ubuntu/)

Feature tests framework is made to run a set of scripts for testing pivoting,
remediation, scale-in, node reuse and upgrade functionalities of Metal3 project.
The framework relies on already existing test scripts of each
feature in Metal3-dev-env. The motivation behind the framework is to be able to
test pivoting/remediation/scale-in/node reuse/upgrade features in Metal3-dev-env
environment and detect breaking changes in advance.

Test-framework CI can be triggered from a pull request in CAPM3, BMO,
metal3-dev-env, project-infra, ironic-image, and
ironic-ipa-downloader repositories.
It is recommended to run test-framework CI especially when
introducing a commit related to pivoting/remediation/scale-in/node reuse/upgrade,
to ensure that new changes will not break the existing functionalities.

Test-framework can be triggered by leaving

- `/test-features` (Ubuntu based)
- `/test-features-centos` (Centos based)

comments for remediation/scale-in/node reuse/pivoting and

- `/test-upgrade-features`

comment for upgrade on a pull request.

The folder structure of the test-framework and its related scripts look
as following:

```ini
feature_tests/
├── cleanup_env.sh
├── feature_test_deprovisioning.sh
├── feature_test_provisioning.sh
├── feature_test_vars.sh
├── inspection_test.sh
├── node_reuse
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── node_reuse.sh
├── OWNERS
├── pivoting
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── pivot.sh
│   ├── repivot.sh
│   └── upgrade.sh
├── README.md
├── remediation
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── remediation.sh
├── setup_env.sh
└── upgrade
    ├── Makefile
    ├── upgrade.sh
    └── upgrade_vars.sh
```

Each feature has its own Makefile that will call feature specific test steps.
`setup_env.sh` is used to build an environment, i.e. run `make`, that will give
N (from the test-framework perspective N=4) number of ready BMH as an output.
`cleanup_env.sh` is used for intermediate cleaning between each feature test.
`feature_test_provisioning.sh` and `feature_test_deprovisioning.sh` are used by
each feature test to provision/deprovision cluster and BMH.

When the test-framework is triggered with `/test-features` or
`/test-features-centos`, it will:

- setup metal3-dev-env
  - run 01_\*, 02_\*, 03_\*, 04_\* scripts
- run remediation tests
  - provision cluster and BMH
  - run remediation tests
  - deprovision cluster and BMH
- clean up the environment
  - run `cleanup_env.sh`
- run pivoting tests
  - provision cluster and BMH
  - run pivoting tests
- run scale-in and node reuse tests
  - run scale-in and node reuse tests for KubeadmControlPlane scenario
  - run node reuse tests for MachineDeployment scenario
- run re-pivoting tests
  - run re-pivoting tests
  - deprovision cluster and BMH
- clean up the environment
  - run `cleanup_env.sh`

When the test-framework is triggered with `/test-upgrade-features`, it will:

- setup metal3-dev-env
  - run 01_\*, 02_\*, 03_\*, 04_\* scripts
- run upgrade tests
  - provision cluster and BMH
  - run upgrade tests
  - deprovision cluster and BMH
  - destroy the environment (i.e. run `make clean`)

## Environment variables

Currently the test-framework uses the following environment variables
by default for feature/upgrade tests, in case of **Ubuntu** setup:

```bash
export IMAGE_OS=Ubuntu
export EPHEMERAL_CLUSTER=kind
export CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker
export NUM_NODES=4
```

while **Centos** uses:

```bash
export IMAGE_OS=Centos
export EPHEMERAL_CLUSTER=minikube
export CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman
export NUM_NODES=4
```

Both **Ubuntu** and **Centos** setups for feature/upgrade tests use:

```bash
export CAPM3_VERSION=v1alpha5
export CAPI_VERSION=v1alpha4
```

Recommended resource requirements for the host machine are: 8C CPUs, 32 GB RAM,
300 GB disk space.

## CI jobs configuration

We are running two master jobs for the **remediation/pivoting** framework testing.
One is
[master](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_ubuntu/)
job for Ubuntu and the other
[master](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_centos/)
job for Centos which runs every day.

Similarly two other jobs,
[airship_*_feature_tests_ubuntu](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_metal3io_metal3_dev_env_feature_tests_ubuntu/)
and
[airship_*_feature_tests_centos](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_metal3io_metal3_dev_env_feature_tests_centos/)
that can be run when triggered with `/test-features` and `/test-features-centos`
phrases for Ubuntu and Centos, accordingly on a pull request.

We are running a single master job(both for Ubuntu and Centos) for the **upgrade**
framework testing. That is a
[master](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_master_feature_tests_upgrade_ubuntu/)
job which runs every night.

Similarly,
[airship_*_feature_tests_upgrade_ubuntu](https://jenkins.nordix.org/view/Airship/job/airship_metal3io_metal3_dev_env_feature_tests_upgrade_ubuntu/)
can be triggered with `/test-upgrade-features` phrase on a pull request.

Depending on where from the job is triggered, **\*** can be:

- metal3io_metal3_dev_env
- metal3io_capi_m3
- metal3io_bmo
- metal3io_project_infra
- metal3io_ironic_ipa_downloader
- metal3io_ironic_image
- nordix_capi_m3
- nordix_metal3_dev_env
- nordix_bmo
